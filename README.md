# Project Proposal

## Title
Task Management Software

## Software System
The aim will be to create a software that allows the user or a group of users to collect and organize any goals or tasks on an easy-to-use webtool. This system will help with group communication and individual organization. This is important because it will allow users to keep track of everything they need to without having too much to go through.

## Consumer Target
It will target users or groups of users who are working to complete a project or work towards a certain goal. This tool will allow them to easily organize their goals and deadlines on a single page, while still allowing other group members to see and potentially update/edit. For example, a programming team working for a company who needs to create an app for a game. This task management software will allow the team members to organize themselves and easily show who will have what job during the process.

## How it Works
From an end-user perspective, this software will have a main canvas area, where all goals/tasks will be visible and able to be moved around and organized. There will be a toolbar either to the side or up top, where the user can add additional new tasks or goals. Each goal/task will also be able to be edited and changed by right-clicking. They can also be checked and marked as completed. All the data will be stored on an online database, so every user on the team will be able to access the team's tasks/goals through any computer, as long as thye are logged into their respective accounts.

## Scope
This project should be doable with 4-6 programmers in one semester. There will need to be a decent amount of front-end and back-end coding, and learning how to create various parts of this project.
